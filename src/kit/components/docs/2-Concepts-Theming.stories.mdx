# Concept

Theming allows you to easily adjust the component visual appearance to suit your app.
Typically the inheritance and style defaults are as follows (in the order of importance):

1. CSS Variable - this will be used as the principal style value
2. `theme.*` value - a value from the `theme` object that will be used as the fallback style value, if there is not CSS variable


## `FlyGlobalStyle />`

To set the defaults for the FlyUI components, import `FlyGlobalStyle />` (ideally) on the rool level of your app.
This component will:
- set the root CSS Custom Properties, that you can later override in a specific component
- provide you with FlyUI basic animations such as `spin` which is used for the `LoadingSpinner />`

## `FlyThemeProvider />`

To get access to the default theme, import `FlyThemeProvider />` (ideally) on the rool level of your app.

## Custom CSS Properties (CSS variables)

FlyUI exposes CSS Variables that are used as defaults to style the components. If you don't define the variables, the values will fallback to the `FlyTheme` or your own theme for `styled-components`.
