# Quickstart

FlyUI aims to provide you with an easy and quick way to implement modern components to your React or Next.js applications.

Currently, it's built with styled-components in mind, but in future we may expand support to emotion and other styling enginges.

## Installation

To install with [**`yarn`**](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install):
```
yarn add flyui-kit
```
or [**`npm`**](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install):
```
npm i flyui-kit
``` 

## Using components

Import the components and use them as you normally would.

```js
import { Avatar, Box, Button } from 'flyui-kit';

const FlyDemo = () => {
  return (
    <Box borderRadius={3} border={2} p={4} maxWidth={700} mx="auto">
      <Avatar
        src="https://source.unsplash.com/92x92/?portrait"
        shape="round"
        outline
      />

      <Button
        hoverEffects="shadow-large lift"
        variant="outline"
        startIcon="edit"
      >
        Fly Button
      </Button>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

## Customizing

FlyUI allows you to easily customize the components via CSS Variables, the `theme` object and more granularly - by adding values directly to the component.
