# FlyUI Kit

Re-usable React Components.


## Testing

To ensure integrity and quality of our components we use Chromatic to conduct snapshot testing.

Without these checks passing no PRs will be merged and we aim for our `main` branch to always be clean.

Our tests ensure that the component match styling criteria against our own theme properties.
When you use components in your own application you should implement your own snapshot, E2E or other types of tests.
